		Optional Project 	Poker Hand Evaluation
									Due: Dec 11, 2013
				 
Repeat the following process 10 times
Deals out 9 hands of five cards each using a random number generator;
Prints the contents of each hand and its "poker value";
Prints the "winning" hand(s) - (the hand(s) with the highest poker rank)

Repeat the following process 6 times
Deal out 8 hands of five cards each using a random number plus one hand provided by the user that should include one of the following hands: straight flush, four of a kind, full house, straight, three of kind and two pairs. 
Prints each hand and indicate the  winning hand

Print each card as a 'pip' character followed by a 'suit' character. 
Pip values run from two through Ace, represented by characters: '2', '3', ...,'9', 'T','J', 'Q', 'K', 'A'. 
Suits are clubs, diamonds, hearts, and spades, represented by characters 'c', 'd', 'h', and 's', respectively. 
A typical hand might be displayed as: 
 Jh 3c 3s Ad Js     two pair 
Your program displays the hand having the highest rank. (Ranking of hands is given below.) 
 You need to submit your program along with an output file 

Poker hands, their rank, and the chance of getting each:
  straight flush (both a straight and a flush: rank = 8)   [Chance: 1 in 65,000] 
  four of a kind (four cards have the same pip: rank = 7.)   [Chance: 1 in 4200] 
  full house (three of a kind plus one pair: rank = 6.)   [Chance: 1 in 694] 
  flush (five cards have the same suit: rank = 5.)   [Chance: 1 in 510] 
  straight (five consecutive pips. Note: Ace is always high. rank = 4)   [Chance: 1 in 256] 
  three of a kind (three pips are the same: rank = 3.)   [Chance: 1 in 48] 
  two pairs (two cards form a pair, and two others form another pair: rank = 2.)   [Chance: 1 in 21] 
  one pair (two cards have the same pip: rank = 1.)   [Chance: 1 in 2.5] 
  garbage (none of the above: rank = 0.)   [Chance: 1 in 2]


Remarks:

Another 100% more points available if you can extend this project to a poker_playing simulation system that allows 2  players to wage, bet and play.
